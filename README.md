# TAROCK
A program to write points

# INTRODUCTION

Tarock is a card game, also known as "tarot" or "tarocco". The game originated in Italy and spread to most of Europe.
The game has many variations, in my contry (Slovenia) the so-called King-calling version is played. Thus, my program is 
specificly targeting that version.

# MEAN OF THE APP

The app is user frenldy and assures awoiding mistakes related with miscalculation. Writting necessary information is
tested to be quicker that the simple math used to add up points. The app covers varous specialities wich varies among player groups.
(The rules are often changed from group to group). I included some humor so users could have a laugh while playing.
