# TAROCK
A program to write points

# INTRODUCTION

Tarock is a card game, also known as "tarot" or "tarocco". The game originated in Italy and spread to most of Europe.
The game has many variations, in my contry (Slovenia) the so-called King-calling version is played. Thus, my program is 
specificly targeting that version.

# MEAN OF THE APP

The app is user frenldy and assures awoiding mistakes related with miscalculation. Writting necessary information is
tested to be quicker that the simple math used to add up points. The app covers varous specialities wich varies among player groups.
(The rules are often changed from group to group). I included some humor so users could have a laugh while playing. 

# IMPROVMENT PLANS

* adding a playfield for 3 and 5 players
* changing the entire look (searching for designer willing to help)
* adding more options due to various rules
* in the future also scanning card for counting points
* adding instructions for use
